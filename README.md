# pyradio-stream
A python3 and Rabbitmq based radio, to stream your own songs

##Why?

This goes on a similar train thought of php7 gameboy emulator, because is Fun!. -->  https://github.com/gabrielrcouto/php-terminal-gameboy-emulator

##Why not using other technologies?

So, Kafka would be the best choice for streaming, and even then, there are probably even better alternatives for that. The thing is, i want to learn more about rabbitmq, this is not a project to really use in a production server, but more about learning how we can extend the capabilities of certain technologies and use them in different ways.
